# Hi, I’m Bessie 👋

I’m a **Cloud & Server Administration student** and tech enthusiast documenting my journey as I build hands-on experience with modern infrastructure.

This GitHub showcases practical labs and projects focused on **server administration, cloud technologies, networking, and security**, with clear documentation along the way.

**Certifications & Training**
- CompTIA Network+
- CompTIA Security+
- Microsoft SC-900
- OSC training

I’m learning by building, documenting, and improving — one lab at a time.
